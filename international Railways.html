          <h2>3.India-Srilanka Railways</h2>
          <h6>The Mannar line was built as part of a plan to create a rail link between Sri Lanka and India. A 22-mile bridge to link the two countries had been proposed
            \ as early as 1894, by the Consultant Engineer for railways in Madras (Chennai). The proposal was given serious consideration and a technical blueprint and 
            cost analysis was conducted. By 1914, the Mannar line was built to connect Talaimannar on Mannar Island to the Sri Lankan mainland. On the Indian side, the
             Indian railway network was extended to Dhanushkodi. The international bridge to link the two was not built.</h6>
